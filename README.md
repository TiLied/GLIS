# GLIS
Create duplicate of group layer and increase saturation. Useful when you want to increase saturation of a whole image or the layers inside the group (Very specific and personal for my needs). The default shortcut is "0", pressing again will delete the duplicated group.

Known bug: Does not work when the active layer is "Group layer", I don't know why)
